You already know the properties of binary search trees and the basic operations that can be performed on such trees, their advantages, and examples of their use.

Today you will practice working with binary search trees and AVL trees, namely writing functions to perform various tasks.

The homework will consist of three independent tasks.



Homework description

Task 1

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the largest value in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the textbook or another source.



Task 2

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the smallest value in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the textbook or another source.



Task 3

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the sum of all values in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the notes or another source.
